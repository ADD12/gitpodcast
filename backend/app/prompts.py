You are tasked with explaining to a principal software engineer how to draw the best and most accurate system design diagram / architecture of a given project. This explanation should be tailored to the specific project's purpose and structure. To accomplish this, you will be provided with two key pieces of information:

1. The complete and entire file tree of the project including all directory and file names, which will be enclosed in <file_tree> tags:
<file_tree>
{file_tree}
</file_tree>

2. The README file of the project, which will be enclosed in <readme> tags:
<readme>
{readme}
</readme>

Analyze these components carefully, as they will provide crucial information about the project's structure and purpose. Follow these steps to create an explanation for the principal software engineer:

1. Identify the project type and purpose:
   - Examine the file structure and README to determine if the project is a full-stack application, an open-source tool, a compiler, or another type of software imaginable.
   - Look for key indicators in the README, such as project description, features, or use cases.

2. Analyze the file structure:
   - Pay attention to top-level directories and their names (e.g., "frontend", "backend", "src", "lib", "tests").
   - Identify patterns in the directory structure that might indicate architectural choices (e.g., MVC pattern, microservices).
   - Note any configuration files, build scripts, or deployment-related files.

3. Examine the README for additional insights:
   - Look for sections describing the architecture, dependencies, or technical stack.
   - Check for any diagrams or explanations of the system's components.

4. Based on your analysis, explain how to create a system design diagram that accurately represents the project's architecture. Include the following points:

   a. Identify the main components of the system (e.g., frontend, backend, database, building, external services).
   b. Determine the relationships and interactions between these components.
   c. Highlight any important architectural patterns or design principles used in the project.
   d. Include relevant technologies, frameworks, or libraries that play a significant role in the system's architecture.

5. Provide guidelines for tailoring the diagram to the specific project type:
   - For a full-stack application, emphasize the separation between frontend and backend, database interactions, and any API layers.
   - For an open-source tool, focus on the core functionality, extensibility points, and how it integrates with other systems.
   - For a compiler or language-related project, highlight the different stages of compilation or interpretation, and any intermediate representations.

6. Instruct the principal software engineer to include the following elements in the diagram:
   - Clear labels for each component
   - Directional arrows to show data flow or dependencies
   - Color coding or shapes to distinguish between different types of components
   - A legend explaining any symbols or abbreviations used

7. Emphasize the importance of keeping the diagram at an appropriate level of abstraction, avoiding too much detail while still capturing the essential architectural elements.

After providing these instructions, ask the principal software engineer to explain their proposed system design diagram in detail, including:

- The main components they've identified
- The relationships between these components
- Any architectural patterns or principles they've incorporated
- How the diagram reflects the specific nature of the project (e.g., full-stack app, open-source tool)
- Any assumptions or decisions they made while creating the diagram

Encourage them to iterate on the diagram based on feedback and further analysis of the codebase.

Present your explanation and instructions within <explanation> tags, ensuring that you tailor your advice to the specific project based on the provided file tree and README content.

SECOND_PROMPT = """
You are a principal software engineer tasked with creating a system design diagram using Mermaid.js based on a detailed explanation. Your goal is to accurately represent the architecture and design of the project as described in the explanation.

Here's the detailed explanation of the design:

<explanation>
{explanation}
</explanation>

To create the Mermaid.js diagram:

1. Carefully read and analyze the provided design explanation.
2. Identify the main components, services, and their relationships within the system.
3. Determine the appropriate Mermaid.js diagram type to use (e.g., flowchart, sequence diagram, class diagram, architecture, etc.) based on the nature of the system described.
4. Create the Mermaid.js code to represent the design, ensuring that:
   a. All major components are included
   b. Relationships between components are clearly shown
   c. The diagram accurately reflects the architecture described in the explanation
   d. The layout is logical and easy to understand

Guidelines for diagram components and relationships:
- Use appropriate shapes for different types of components (e.g., rectangles for services, cylinders for databases, etc.)
- Use clear and concise labels for each component
- Show the direction of data flow or dependencies using arrows
- Group related components together if applicable
- Include any important notes or annotations mentioned in the explanation
- Just follow the explanation. It will have everything you need.

Your output should be valid Mermaid.js code that can be rendered into a diagram. Begin your response with the Mermaid.js code fence:

Your response must strictly be just the Mermaid.js code, without any additional text or explanations.
No code fence or markdown ticks needed, simply return the Mermaid.js code.

Ensure that your diagram adheres strictly to the given explanation, without adding or omitting any significant components or relationships.
